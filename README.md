# digital-clock
a digital clock built with html, css, and javascript
I've added a code to make it 12 hour format as well as a code to make it 24 hour format you can chose either one of them
(I never understood the 24 hour format so the 12 hour is for those who don't understand it like me ðŸ˜…)
there's also a condition where if the time is 0 it means 12 so it simply disiplays 12 and if the time is 4 or any one digit (hours, minuts, or seconds) it adds a 0 before it 

if anyone has any Idea on how to upgrade the code and make it better pleas let me know I would love to
